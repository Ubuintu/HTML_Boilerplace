        <p>This works since index & about page are in the same directory, meaning we can use the name of about.html file as the value of the href attribute as a link</p>
        <h2>Here is an example of accessing an item from the parent directory</h2>
        <h3>Behold of Charles!</h3>
        <!-- Beside every src attribute, every image element should have an alt (alternative text) attribute. -->
        <p>The alt attribute is used to describe an image, it will be used in place of the image should someone have an issue viewing it</p>
        <img src="../images/dog.jpg" alt="It's Charles the Dog!">
