    <h1>JPG images<h1>
    <p>JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing the file size. This makes them great for photos and images with lots of gradients in them.
    However, JPGS don't allow for transparent pixels.</p>

    <h1>GIF images</h1>
    <p>GIFs are used for simple animations, however they're somewhat limited in terms of color palette-never use them for photos. Transparent pixels are a binary option for GIFs,
    meaning you can't have semi-opaque pixels. This can make it difficult to get high levels of detail on a transparent background. For this reason, its better to use PNG images
    if you don't need animations.</p>
